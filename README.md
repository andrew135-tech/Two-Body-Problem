# Two-Body-Problem
This is a repository that has some python code to simulate a two-body problem with Newtonian physics. In this repo I have included a python file to complete the simulation.

Though I hope to add another video soon. I have included some basic working values in the code but experment and get new working ones. If you find one comment on my video and tell me about it. I have included basic examples in the code comments at the top of the file. Please experment and absoultely tell me about them via a comment on my video. I hope you like this and have a good time with it.
